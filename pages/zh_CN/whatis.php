	  where were you when they took freedom of the press away from the
	  Internet?'"

	Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse 
	and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat 
	on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it 
	less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only 
	connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are
	routed through other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine
	who is requesting the information and what its content is.
      </p>

      <p>
	Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of
	their hard drive (called the "data store") for storing files. 
	Files are automatically kept or
	deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being
	discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files
	are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in
	his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it. Chat forums,
	websites, and search functionality, are all built on top of this distributed 
	data store.
      </p>
      <p>
	Freenet has been downloaded over 2 million times since the project
	started, and used for the distribution of censored information all
	over the world including countries such as <a
						      href="http://freenet-china.org">China</a> and the Middle East.  Ideas
	and concepts pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the
	academic world.  Our 2000 paper "Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous
	Information Storage and Retrieval System" was the most cited computer
	science paper of 2000 according to Citeseer, and
	Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of law and philosophy. 
	Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator, was selected as
	one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology Review
	magazine.

      <p>
	An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the
	"darknet": By only connecting to people they trust, users can greatly reduce 
	their vulnerability, and yet still connect to a global network through their
	friends' friends' friends and so on. This enables people to use Freenet even
	in places where Freenet may be illegal, makes it very difficult for 
	governments to block it, and does not rely on tunneling to the "free world".
