<h3>What is Freenet?</h3>
Freenet is free software which lets you publish and obtain information on the Internet without fear of censorship.  To achieve this freedom, the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are anonymous. Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack.

<p>
Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are "routed-through" other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the information and what its content is.
<p>
Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive (called the "data store") for storing files. Unlike other peer-to-peer file sharing networks, Freenet does not let the user control what is stored in the data store. Instead, files are kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files in the data store are encrypted to reduce the likelihood of prosecution by persons wishing to censor Freenet content.
<p>
The network can be used in a number of different ways and isn't restricted to just sharing files like other peer-to-peer networks. It acts more like an Internet within an Internet. For example Freenet can be used for:

<ul>
<li>Publishing websites or 'freesites'
<li>Communicating via message boards
<li>Playing simple turn-based games like Chess
<li>Content distribution
</ul>
<p>
Freenet is not just theoretical, it has been downloaded by over 1.2 million users since the project started, and it is used for the distribution of censored information all over the world, including countries such as China and the Middle East.  Ideas and concepts pioneered in Freenet have <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/1354204/420356">inspired</a> hundreds of academic papers in the fields of computer communication, security, and law.  Freenet has also received significant coverage in the mainstream press.
