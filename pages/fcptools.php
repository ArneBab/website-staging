<h2>What are the FCPTools?

</h2>
<br/>The most useful component of the FCPTools is ezFCPlib, a portable ANSI-C based Freenet Client Library. It's been written to make writing Freenet clients as easy as possible.
<br/>
<br/>In addition, the FCPTools include command line utilities to insert and retrieve files (fcpput, fcpputsplit, fcpget) as well as entire freesites (fcpputsite) via ezFCPlib.
<br/>
