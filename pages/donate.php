<h3>Donations</h3>
<h4>Why does The Freenet Project need donations?</h4>
Although countless people have given their time and skill to the project since it's
inception The Freenet Project relies on your donations both to support those developers
working full-time on this increasingly complex project, and to cover hardware(ie. the
project development computer) and administrative costs(ie.domain registrations). It is also
a goal to be able find ourselves in the position to start a legal defense fund to help
ensure the future of Freenet development.<br> Everyone involved is keenly interested in the
future of The Freenet Project and you can be assured donations have been and will continue
to be used wisely, all support is very much appreciated.
