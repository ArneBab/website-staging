<h4>Why does The  
Freenet Project need 
donations?</h4>
The Freenet Project 
relies on your donations both to support those developers working 
full-time on the project, and to cover hardware and administrative 
costs.
<h4>How can I be sure that my donation will be used appropriately?</h4>
All donations go to The  
Freenet Project Inc, a 
non-profit 501c3 corporation with the following 
mission
