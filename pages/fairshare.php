<h3>FairShare - Rewarding artists without Copyright</h3>
  <h3>Ian Clarke - 29th March 2001</h3>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  With advances in communication technology, such as the Internet, and
  systems like <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a>, comes
  the realization that copyright law is increasingly unenforceable
  without seriously curtailing people's freedom to communicate.  It
  has also raised questions about the validity of copyright law
  itself, and the ideas upon which it is founded, particularly the
  idea that information is property.<br></br>
  This raises the obvious question of how to enable people to earn a
  living from the creation of useful information in the absence of
  copyright law.  One obvious solution is to allow those who value a
  creative work to voluntarily contribute to its creator.  The
  Internet makes such a solution much more likely to be effective,
  given the ease with which an artist can receive contributions
  through companies such as <a 
href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>.   Many people, however,
  do not believe that such a mechanism will be effective since it
  relies on people having a wider sense of self interest (if they
  don't contribute to the artist, then it is less likely that the
  artist will continue to create).  While my personal belief is that
  this simple voluntary payment approach can work, there are also ways
  that it can be enhanced to answer this criticism.

  <h3>Everybody can be the record label</h3>
  Consider a simplistic view of how a record label operates.  They
  find early-stage bands who are yet to have a wide audience, but who
  they consider to have the potential to be very successful.  They
  invest money in that band, and if that band does indeed become a
  success they make a return on their investment.<br></br>
  FairShare essentially democratizes this process.  Anybody can
  "invest" in an artist, and if that artist goes on to be a success,
  then the person is reward in proportion to their investment and how
  early they made it.<br></br>
  But where does this return on investment come from?  The answer is
  that it comes from subsequent investors.  For example, lets say that
  you invest $10.  $4.50 might go straight to the band, $1 might go to
  the operator of the system, and the remaining $4.50 would be
  distributed among previous investors in the band, those who invested
  more early would get a bigger proportion than those who invested
  less, later-on.<br></br>
  Of course, most people will not make a profit, but they are rewarded
  by knowing that they contributed towards an artist that they liked,
  and helped reward others who believed in that artist, and who may
  have brought the artist to their attention.

  <h3>Collaborative Filtering</h3>
  One of the positive aspects of what record labels claim to do is to
  filter out the "noise", and present the public with the best of what
  is available.  Of course, this aspect can be mirrored in our
  scheme.  A FairShare operator could provide a randomized list of
  artists, biased towards those who have recieved more contributions,
  but with the occasional new act to give them some exposure.

  <P><B><U>Some answers to common questions:</U></B></P>

  <h3>Isn't this a "Pyramid Scheme"?</h3>
  I don't think so although I am not a lawyer.  The problem with
  Pyramid Schemes is that they give the impression that you are
  guaranteed a return, which is simply a lie.  In the case of
  FairShare, we are completely honest about the fact that most people
  will not make a profit, but those people benefit by rewarding
  artists they like.

  <h3>Might there be other reasons why this is illegal?</h3>
  Of course, any new idea could be illegal (just ask Napster!),
  it is impossible to tell until it is challenged in court.  Having
  said that, I can't think of any reason why this <i>should</i> be
  illegal provided that those who contribute to artists are not
  mislead as to the nature of the system.

  <h3>How will the maths work?</h3>
  Good question.  There are actually many choices as to how funds can
  be distributed to investors in an artist.  Some of these will allow
  early-investors to make more of a profit, and some will distribute
  funds more evenly.  We will let the market decide as to which is
  best.

  <h3>Won't FairShare operators just become another monopoly?</h3>
  Hopefully not.  We would discourage artists from using a FairShare
  operator who insisted on an exclusive relationship for this reason.
  Provided that there is sufficient competition, it will keep margins
  down, and the free market should lead to the evolution of optimal
  approaches.

  <h3>Who thought of this?</h3>
  This mechanism was developed by <a href="mailto:steven@change.tv">
    Steven Starr</a>, <a href="mailto:rob@nowbenow.com">Rob Kramer</a>,
  and myself as a response to the impossibility of enforcing copyright
  law without restricting people's ability to communicate.  The name
  "FairShare" is due to Steven Starr.  I am not aware of any similar
  approaches currently in existence.
   
  <h3>What has this got to do with Freenet?</h3>
  Not much, except that the amount of feedback we received in the
  press concerning Freenet's effect on copyright got us thinking about
  this problem.
