<h1> The Philosophy behind Freenet </h1>
<h3> By Ian Clarke </h3>
<p>
</p><h3> 1. A Disclaimer </h3> There are
many reasons why people get involved in the Freenet Project. Some share
the views outlined in this document; some share variations of these
views, which are also served by what we are trying to achieve; and some
just enjoy the technical challenge. These are the ideas which motivated
me to architect the system in the first place, but not necessarily the
views that everyone involved in the Freenet project holds. <p>

</p><h3> 2. Suggested prior reading </h3>
For this document to make sense, you should probably know what Freenet is. You can get a good overview on the <a href="/whatis.html">What is Freenet?</a> page.
<p>
</p><h3> 3. The importance of the Free flow of information  </h3>
Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally considered to
be one of the most important rights any individual might have. Why is
the freedom to share ideas and opinions so important? There are several
ways to answer this question. <p>
</p><h3> 3.1 Communication is what makes us human </h3>
One of the most obvious differences between mankind and the rest of the
animal kingdom is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract
concepts. While we constantly discover that animal's communication
ability is more sophisticated than previously assumed, it is unlikely
that any other animal approaches our own level of ability in this area. <p>

</p><h3> 3.2 Knowledge is good </h3>
Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing
something, will choose to have more information rather than less. Wars
have been won and lost over who was better-informed. This is because
being better-informed allows us to make better decisions, and generally
improve our ability to survive and be successful. <p>
</p><h3> 3.3 Democracy assumes a well informed population </h3>
Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who
don't, probably want to. Democracy is an answer to the question of how
to create leaders, while preventing them from abusing that power. It
achieves this by giving the population the power to regulate their
government through voting, yet the ability to vote does not necessarily
mean that you live in a democratic country. For a population to
regulate their government effectively it must know what their
government is doing, they must be well informed. It is a feedback loop,
but this loop can be broken if the government has the power to control
the information the population has access to. <p>
</p><h3> 4. Censorship and freedom </h3>
Everyone values their freedom, in fact, many consider it so important
that they will die for it. People like to think that they are free to
form and hold whatever opinions they like, particularly in western
countries. Consider now that someone had the ability to control the
information you have access to. This would give them the ability to
manipulate your opinions by hiding some facts from you, by presenting
you with lies and censoring anything that contradicted those lies. This
is not some Orwellian fiction, it is standard practice for most western
governments to lie to their populations, so much so, that people now
take it for granted, despite the fact that this undermines the very
democratic principles which justify the government's existence in the
first place. <p>
</p><h3> 5. The solution </h3> The only way
to ensure that a democracy will remain effective is to ensure that the
government cannot control its population's ability to share
information, to communicate. So long as everything we see and hear is
filtered, we are not truly free. Freenet's aim is to allow two or more
people who wish to share information, to do so. <p>

</p><h3> 6. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary? </h3>
Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that
censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some
European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is
illegal. Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which
are deemed damaging to society. There are two answers to this however.
The first is that you can't allow those in power to impose "good"
censorship, without also enabling them to impose "bad" censorship. To
impose any form of censorship a government must have the ability to
monitor and thus restrict communication. There are already criticisms
that the anti-racism censorship in many European countries is hampering
legitimate historical analysis of events such as the second world war. <p> The second argument is that this "good" censorship is
counter-productive even when it does not leak into other areas. For
example, it is generally more effective when trying to persuade someone
of something to present them with the arguments against it, and then
answer those arguments. Unfortunately, preventing people from being
aware of the often sophisticated arguments used by racists, makes them
vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually encounter them. </p><p> Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would
still hold-true even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you
either have censorship, or you don't. There is no middle-ground. </p><p>
</p><h3> 7. But why is anonymity necessary? </h3>
You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain
anonymous. Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much
easier to curtail free speech by punishing those who exercise it
afterward, rather than preventing them from doing it in the first
place. The only way to prevent this is to remain anonymous. It is a
common misconception that you cannot trust anonymous information. This
is not necessarily true, using digital signatures people can create a
secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can learn to trust.
Freenet incorporates a mechanism called "subspaces" to facilitate this. 
<h3> 8. And what of copyright? </h3>

Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of
copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with
copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of
communications, and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is
monitoring everything you say. This is important, most people fail to
see or address this point when debating the issue of copyright, so let
me make it clear: <p>
</p><center>You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law</center> 
<p>
It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright.
</p><p>
</p><h3> 9. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright? </h3>
<p> Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be
rewarded for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more
important than having professional artists (those who claim that we
would have no art do not understand creativity: people will always
create, it is a compulsion, the only question is whether they can do it
for a living). </p><p> Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is
effective even now. The music industry is one of the most vocally
opposed to enhancements in communication technology, yet according to
many of the artists who should be rewarded by copyright, it is failing
to do so. Rather it has allowed middle-men to gain control over the
mechanisms of distribution, to the detriment of both artists and the
public. </p><p>
</p><h3> 10. Alternatives to Copyright </h3>

Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to
reward artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension
of the patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists
prior to copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to
allow them to create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting
extension of this idea, where rather than having just one wealthy
patron, you could have hundreds of thousands, contributing small
amounts of money over the Internet. <p> We actually practice what we preach in this regard too, on the
15th of March 2001 the Freenet Project started taking donations, and
within a week we had collected over $1000. </p><p>
</p><h3> 11. More sophisticated approaches: Fairshare </h3>
Of course some people ridicule this idea on the basis (I assume) that
nobody would ever pay for something unless forced to do so (despite
significant evidence to the contrary). While I disagree with their
rather depressing outlook on humanity, there are more sophisticated
mechanisms which do appeal to people's self-interest, such as
"Fairshare", where people can buy in to artists much as a venture
capitalist will buy into an idea they like, and if that artist is
successful they will be rewarded in proportion to their original
contribution. This has the nice effect of encouraging people to give
more money to obscure artists who they believe have potential. If their
investment doesn't pay-off, then they still have the satisfaction that
they contributed to an artist whose work they enjoy.
