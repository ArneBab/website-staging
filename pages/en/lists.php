<h3>The lists</h3>
<a class='wiki'  
href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/announce/'>Announcements</a> (<a 
class='wiki'  href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/announce.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />Please sign up here to be notified of major Freenet developments, such as announcements of new releases or important bugfixes.  This list is moderated and is very low traffic (less than one message per month).
<br />

<br /><a
href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/support/'>Support</a>
(<a
href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/support.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />Asking for or giving advice relating to getting Freenet working, 
bug reports, and suggestions on improving the user experience. Requests 
for help are more likely to be heard here than in the other mailing 
lists.  <b>Note: </b> Emails sent to this mailing list from those not 
subscribed to the list must be manually approved, and this can impose 
a delay of several days.  To avoid this delay, please <a 
href="http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/support/">subscribe</a>.
<br />
<br /><a
href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tech/'>Tech</a>
(<a
href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/tech.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />
This is for general technical discussion of Freenet.  If you want to discuss
longer-term technical ideas about Freenet, please use this list.
<br />
<br /><a class='wiki'  
href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devl/'>Development</a> (<a 
class='wiki'  href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/devl.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />
This list is for active developers to discuss bugs, and the implementation 
of near-term new features.  Please only post to this list if you know what 
you are talking about, otherwise use the tech mailing list (see above).
<br />
<br /><a class='wiki'  href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cvs'>CVS</a>  
(<a class='wiki'  href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/cvs.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />A read-only mailing list to which CVS checkins are mailed.  This will probably only be of interest to developers.
<br />
<br /><a class='wiki' href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/darknet-tools/'>Darknet-Tools<a> (<a 
class='wiki' href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/darknet-tools.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />A mailing list to discuss and develop ways of extending the darknet while keeping it a darknet: 
Instant messenger plugins, IRC plugins, email invitations, functionality in the node needed to 
support these, and any other means of extending the darknet while keeping it a darknet as much as
possible.
<br />
<br /><a class='wiki'  
href='http://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/chat/'>Chat</a> (<a 
class='wiki'  href='http://archives.freenetproject.org/list/chat.en.html'>archive</a>)
<br />
This list is for general discussion of Freenet, topics that are not suitable 
to other lists. Discussions of politics, law, philosophy, lawsuits, 
programming languages, related technology that should not be part of
Freenet, and any thread that the developers and users don't deem appropriate 
to the main lists should be discussed here. Questions such as "How can I prevent 
my node from being used by terrorists?", or "Why don't you rewrite Freenet in C++?"
should be addressed to this list.
