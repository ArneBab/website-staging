<p><b>31st Mar, 2008 - Freenet 0.7.0 release candidate 1 released</b></p>
<p>Freenet version 0.7 Release Candidate 1 is now available for public testing.</p>
<p>Freenet is a global peer-to-peer network designed to allow users to publish and 
consume information without fear of censorship.  To use it, you must download the 
Freenet software, available for Windows, Mac, Linux and other operating systems.  
Once you install and run Freenet, your computer will join a global, decentralized 
P2P network. You will be able to publish and consume information anonymously, either 
through your web browser, or through a variety of third party applications.</p>
<p>Freenet 0.7 is a ground-up rewrite of Freenet.  The key user-facing feature in 
Freenet 0.7 is the ability to operate Freenet in a "darknet" mode, where your Freenet 
node will only talk to other Freenet users that you trust.  This makes it much more 
difficult for an adversary to discover that you are using Freenet, let alone what 
you are doing with it. 0.7 also includes significant improvements to both security 
and performance.</p>
<p>Freenet 0.7 RC1 can be downloaded from:</p>
<p><a href="http://freenetproject.org/download.html">http://freenetproject.org/download.html</a></p>
<p>This release would not have been possible without the release of numerous volunteers, 
and Matthew Toseland, Freenet's full time developer. Matthew's work is funded through 
donations via our website (as well as a few larger sponsors from time to time).  We ask 
that anyone who can help us to ensure Matthew's continued employment visit our donations 
page and make a contribution at:</p>

<p>The Freenet Project is also participating in the Google Summer of Code project this 
year, if you are interested in joining, please see the Summer of Code site as soon as 
possible:</p>

<p><b>17th Mar, 2008 - Freenet accepted into Google Summer of Code 2008</b></p>
<p>Google has accepted us into their <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Summer of Code</a> 
for the third year. The last two years have been a mixed bag, but some good code has
come out of it (not least Thaw), and some good developers too. This year we will be doing
fewer projects than last year because we only have two confirmed mentors, and we will
be selecting candidates more carefully. If you want to get paid $4,500 by Google to 
work on Freenet over the summer, please have a look at the 
<a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/SummerOfCode2008">wiki page</a> (including ideas list, 
although feel free to suggest a proposal that isn't there)
and <a href="mailto:devl@freenetproject.org">contact us</a>.</p>

<p><b>29th Jan, 2008 - Freenet 0.7.0a2 alphatest released</b></p>
<p>Freenet version 0.7a2 is now available for public testing.</p>
<p>Freenet is a global peer-to-peer network designed to allow users to publish 
and consume information without fear of censorship.  To use it, you must download 
the Freenet software, available for Windows, Mac, Linux and other operating systems.  
Your computer will then form part of a global, decentralized P2P network, and you 
will be able to publish and consume information anonymously, either through your 
web browser, or through a variety of third party applications, such as Frost (see 
<a href="http://jtcfrost.sf.net/">http://jtcfrost.sf.net/</a>).</p>
<p>Since the first alpha there have been vast numbers of changes, in particular 
significant improvements in user friendliness.  For example, it is no-longer 
necessary to find other people to connect to, Freenet can find other people for you. 
However, you can still connect to your friends for maximum security. It is also a 
good deal faster, and many bugs have been fixed.</p>
<p>There have been many many other changes, and we will release a feature complete 
beta followed by 0.7.0 itself in the coming months (we hope to have regular point 
releases after that). But we thought it would be best to get some wider testing at 
this point. There is more to do before 0.7.0, and one or two features which need to 
be completed before that.</p>
<p>Freenet 0.7a2 can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://freenetproject.org/download.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release would not have been possible without the work of numerous 
volunteers, and Matthew Toseland, Freenet's full time developer. Matthew's work is 
funded through donations via our website (as well as a few larger sponsors from time 
to time), we ask that anyone who can help us to ensure Matthew's continued 
employment by visiting our donations page and making a contribution at
