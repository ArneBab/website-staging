<p><b>15th May, 2007 - John Pozadzides donates $10,000 to Freenet Project</b></p>
John Pozadzides, founder of <a href="http://HTMLHelp.com">HTMLHelp.com</a> and former Vice President of Sales for <a href="http://savvis.net">SAVVIS Communications</a>, has donated $10,000 to the Freenet Project to fund ongoing
development of the Freenet software.  John says:
<blockquote>
More than a decade ago when I founded HTMLHelp.com I had a vision of the Internet as the “great equalizer”. I believed that it would free us from the content filtering imposed by mega-media companies and governments. It turns out this has been true for most of us - but not all.
<p/>
I view supporting the Freenet Project as a logical extension of that original dream, this time to include people who were previously unable to freely participate.
</blockquote>
This donation will be used to fund general development, and in particular, improvements to software usability and stability.  A specific
goal is the completion of Freenet's "opennet" functionality which will make it far easier for many users to get Freenet up and running.
<p/>
Anyone is free to make their own donation to the project, via a variety of convenient methods including Paypal and Google Checkout through our <a href="donate.html">donations page</a>.

<p><b>12 March, 2007 - Google Summer of Code update</b></p>
<p>We have selected 6 students to work for us over the summer, paid for by 
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/freenet/about.html">Google Summer of Code</a>.<p>
<p>These are:
<ul>
<li><b>Swati Goyal</b> will be working on improving searching in Freenet.</li>
<li><b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Rechtenstein</b> will be building us a blogging plugin.</li>
<li><b>Alberto Bacchelli</b> will be building a test framework and many unit tests.</li>
<li><b>Vilhelm Verendel</b> will be working on simulating the growth of the network.</li>
<li><b>Srivatsan</b> will be working on improving Freenet's connection encryption and possibly on darknet introductions.</li>
<li><b>Mladen Kolar</b> will be building a definitive C/C++ library for the <a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/FreenetFCPSpec2Point0">Freenet Client Protocol</a>.</li></p>
</ul><p>Congratulations to all of these students. Last year's Summer of Code yielded results including
<a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/Thaw">Thaw</a>, <a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/Freemail">Freemail</a>,
new low-level simulations and a great deal of work on the installer, packaging and general bugfixing. Even better,
two of last year's students are now core developers themselves mentoring Summer of Code students this year !
