<h2>Share, chat and browse anonymously on the Free Network</h2>
<p> Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse 
and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat 
on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it 
less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only 
connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect.</p>
