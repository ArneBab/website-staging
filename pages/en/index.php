<h3>What is Freenet?</h3>
<p> Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse 
and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and 
chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Users are anonymous, and 
Freenet is entirely decentralised. Without anonymity there can never be 
true freedom of speech, and without decentralisation the network would be 
vulnerable to attack.</p>
