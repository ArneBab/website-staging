she's too young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I
worry that 10 or 15 years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy,
where were you when they took freedom of the press away from the
Internet?'"</i><br>

<h2>What is Freenet?</h2>
<p> Freenet is free software which lets you
publish and obtain information on the Internet without fear of
censorship.  To achieve this freedom, the network is entirely
decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are anonymous.
Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and without
decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack.</p>
