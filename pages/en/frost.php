      <h2>Frost</h2>
      <p>
	Frost is an application for Freenet that 
	provides usenet-like message boards and 
	file uploading/downloading/sharing 
	functionalities. It should get installed 
	with Freenet 0.7 automatically if you 
	used the standard Freenet installers.
      </p>
      <p>
	To run Frost on Linux from the command 
	line, change to your Freenet install 
	directory, then change to the frost 
	subdirectory. Then make the frost.sh
	file executable, and run it:
      </p>
      <pre>
	cd /home/username/
	cd frost/
	chmod +x ./frost.sh
	./frost.sh</pre>
      <p>
	The first time you start Frost, you will
	get a number of dialogs. The first ask
	you if you would like to import old
	Frost data. If this is the first time you
	use Freenet at all, you can safely answer
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clean startup</span> 
	here.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since Freenet is able to run on both Freenet 0.5
	and the current Freenet 0.7, you will need to
	specify which version you want to run with. If you
	have followed the previous install instructions,
	you will probably want 
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Freenet 0.7 (Darknet)</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Next step is to choose which identidy you want to be
	known by when using Frost. As it says, it does not
	have to be unique, but it certainly helps.
      </p>

      <p>
	You will then get the main Frost window, where one
	can participate in the message boards and up/download
	files. The windows will probably take a while to
	populate on the first startup.
      </p>

      <h3>Sharing files</h3>
      <p>
	Sharing files can be done by clicking the
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shared files</span>
	-tab and then clicking on the Folder-icon top left
	in the appearing tab.
      </p>
      <h3>Further information</h3>
      <p>
	Additional information about Frost can be found in
	the mailing-list or on the official
	website: <a href="http://jtcfrost.sourceforge.net/">Frost
	Homepage</a>
