<h2>What is Freenet?</h2>
<p> Freenet is free software which lets you
publish and obtain information on the Internet without fear of
censorship.  To achieve this freedom, the network is entirely
decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are anonymous.
Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and without
decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p> Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are
routed through other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine
who is requesting the information and what its content is.</p>

<p> Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of
their hard drive (called the "data store") for storing files. 
Files are automatically kept or
deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being
discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files
are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in
his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it.</p>

<p> Freenet is not a traditional filesharing network, it is more like an
Internet within the Internet. For example, users can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Publish websites or 'freesites'</li>
<li>Communicate via message boards</li>
<!--
<li>Playing simple turn-based games like Chess
for gosh's sake remove this turn-based idiosyncrasy.-->
<li>Distribute files</li>
<li>Send email messages</li>
</ul>
<p>
Freenet has been downloaded by over 2 million users since the project
started, and used for the distribution of censored information all
over the world including countries such as <a
href="http://freenet-china.org">China</a> and the Middle East.  Ideas
and concepts pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the
academic world.  Our 2000 paper "Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous
Information Storage and Retrieval System" was the most cited computer
science paper of 2000 according to <a
href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/articles2000.html">Citeseer</a>, and
Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of law and philosophy. 
Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator, was selected as
one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology Review
magazine.

An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the
"darknet": Freenet can operate in a purely friend-to-friend mode, and yet
still be a globally scalable, reasonably efficient network. By only 
connecting to people they trust, users can greatly reduce their vulnerability,
even in places where running Freenet may be illegal, and the website blocked.
Through their friends' friends, because of the small world effect, a global
darknet is possible, even if there is no "free world" to tunnel to, or it is
not practical to do so.
