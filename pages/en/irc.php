<h1>Chat with us on IRC</h1>

<p>Many of the developers and users of Freenet can often be found on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> channel,
#freenet on chat.freenode.net. Almost everyone on the channel is a volunteer, and 
may be busy with other things, so you may not get an instant answer: <b>Ask your 
question/say what the problem is, then wait for a few minutes, and somebody 
may help you</b>.</p>

<p>If you do not get an answer within the first few minutes, please
keep the chat window open. We read our backlog, and if you stay, you
will normally get an answer <b>within at most 4 hours</b> (when people
with the relevant knowledge wake up).<p>
