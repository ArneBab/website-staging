<h1>Applications over Freenet

</h1>
<br/><b>Here you can share ideas about new applications that can run on top of Freenet. Before posting you should do a search on "Freenet" in <a class='wiki'  href='http://sourceforge.net/'>Sourceforge</a> to see if someone else hasn't already started a similiar project. <p>

<br/><a class='wiki'  href='http://lookoutpx.sourceforge.net/'><b>Lookout PX</b></a>
<br/>
<br/>Lookout PX is a modular, extendable Freenet client for Windows written in C++. Plug-ins are loaded dynamically and may extend virtually every aspect of Lookout. Currently under development is a transport-independent messaging subsystem, such that any messaging system (TOF, FMB, etc.) can be implemented for Lookout with a standard interface.
<br/>
<br/>Developers familiar with MFC, Win32 programming, or Freenet in general are wanted. Anyone is welcome to contact <a class='wiki'  href='mailto:delta407@invisiblenet.net'>delta407@invisiblenet.net</a> to get more information about the project.

<br/>
<br/>As of yet, there is no public release of Lookout, but a roadmap is on the table and a release -- a good release -- is approaching. Check <a class='wiki'  href='http://www.lookoutpx.net/'>http://www.lookoutpx.net/</a> for updates. (Plus, it is safe to expect there some kind of announcement on the freenet-tech list, in addition to informing C of E and a few others.)

<br/>
<br/>This is a proposal for a hybrid filesharing system. NRAF will use Freenet as a backbone for searching and listing shares, but the shared items will not be inserted. Transfers between users will be direct, and the users will not be anonymous.
<br/>
<br/>Why would anyone want such thing?
<br/>
<br/><ul><li> Thanks to intelligent routing of Freenet NRAF will be efficient for the users, becoming eventually more efficient than the other filesharing apps.

</li><li> It will also be efficient for Freenet, because the big mp3 and divx files will not be inserted.
</li><li> If NRAF gets popular more <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">people</b> will be running nodes. Freenet in every home?
</li><li> Other filesharing apps aren't anonymous either
</li><li> It could be implemented as a plugin/module to an existing (and poupular) gnutella client.
</li></ul>
It is a win-win situation; those who want to share and leech get to do it more efficiently (even though not anonymously), and those who need anonymity for real reasons will have a more efficient Freenet, thanks to the larger number of nodes.
<br/>
<br/>And last but not least, if NRAF becomes popular, instead of blaming Freenet for facilitating copyright infringment and spreading kiddie porn the authorities will blame NRAF.

<br/>"So I decided to start work on a native Win32 Frost client (that I have named Flame). It won't have file exchange support but just really basic
<br/>
<br/>messaging functionality. I have been able to retrieve todays Freenet board Frost messages with it and read them in it (other boards should work too) but there are a few things to do (being able to write & insert messages and reply to messages in particular) but it is coming along nicely and I shall place it on the site once I have a more or less functional version up and running."
