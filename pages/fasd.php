<h2>FASD:A Fault-tolerant, Adaptive, Scalable,Distributed Search Engine </h2>
<br/><h3><a name ="Abstract"> Abstract </a></h3>
<br/>This paper introduces <b>FASD</b>, a fault-tolerant, adaptive, scalable,

<br/>and distributed search layer designed to augment existing peer-to-peer
<br/>applications.  The FASD layer operates as a network of identical nodes
<br/>that collectively pool their storage space to cache 'metadata keys' and
<br/>cooperatively route queries to the nodes most likely to satisfy them. A
<br/>'metadata key' is a list of weighted terms that describe the information
<br/>content of a document in the underlying network. Although completely
<br/>decentralized, FASD's approach is able to efficiently match the recall
<br/>and precision of a centralized search engine. Simulation results
<br/>indicate that latency and bandwidth consumption scale logarithmically
<br/>with the size of a FASD network.
