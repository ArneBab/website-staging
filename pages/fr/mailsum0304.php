<p>
Made a first attempt to make my <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">www.freenethelp.org</a> more wikish - for the moment only the main page. <br>
Let me know what you think of it (if it's an improvement or not). <p>
As millenia pass bye, more will become available. <p>
Could be I will use something of Ian that he and I are discussing, if I ever figur out how to actually install and run it myself (which is not the case with the current wikish-thingy, btw).

A certain dude with the French-sounding name Anthony Le Mansec responded with saying that he was not keen on wikifarms like seedwiki, but he was convinced a wiki was really suitable for such a site, and would perfectly fit with freenet's philosophy. It would also be a target of choice for Wiki 'saboteurs', thus requiring a lot of time - at least until many users regurlarly "tend the garden".  Furthermore he suggested  the wiki Usemod.<p>
<b>Update:</b> The site <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">www.freenethelp.org</a> was converted from a wikifarm to a real 'own' wiki-server (though not Usemod for various reasons). As newsbyte, eternally pessimistic about human nature, had forseen: there was and is little to no editing being done. Luckily, there also was little sabotage done (had not much use anyway, since one can always revert). That said, the site is moderately succesful with about 100 unique hits a day, only the freenet-knowledgable dudes don't seem to bother to update it, which, as newsbyte said in a run-up post, could be frustrating:<p>

Newsbyte's latest post about the subject was:
<p>
<div style="font-style:italic;">Hi there, <br>
I have slightly changed the <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">www.freenethelp.org </a>site. Since some told me they found the login a hurdle for editing pages, and since the generic one had not much practical value, I've decide to drop it untill I can finetune it better. Added RecentChanges too, although in the beta-version of the prog it doesn't show the diff yet; hopefully this will become possible when it comes out of beta. <p>
In any case, this is a new appeal for/to everyone that is somehow involved/knows about freenet to have a look and update the stuff. 
But also for the newbies: feel free to give the site more structure and weed out spellingmistakes, etc. <p>
For instance, the goal is to structure and mix together some of the ex-freesite-pages. Unofficial FAQ and Unoffical Anti-FAQ should become 'Ultimate FAQ' (already began with that), Freenet Explained and Freenet Explained2 should also be merged, etc. <p>
If you have a free moment (and even if you don't ;-), go have a look and update where possible! The site is pretty well visited, so ppl are finding it usefull (or at least are curious), but the main prob is, that it's currently not very up-to-date, which could be frustrating, especially in the 'how to start' section or when trouble-shooting.<p> 
Thus, pls, give it a try and edit/update! <p>
