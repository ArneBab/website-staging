<h3><a href="/index.php?page=fcptools">Freenet Client Protocol Tools (FCPTools)</a></h3>
<p>The FCPTools are ANSI-C based Freenet client tools, and a separate FCP specific library called ezFCPlib. Specifically, FCPTools include command line utilities to insert and retrieve files (fcpput, fcpputsplit, fcpget) within Freenet, as well as entire freesites (fcpputsite) via ezFCPlib.</p>

<p>
<h3><a href="/index.php?page=fcp">FCP (Freenet Client 
  Protocol)</a></h3>
<p>FCP is intended to shield would-be Freenet client developers from the details and ever-changing internals of the Freenet node itself.</p>

<p>
<h3><a href="/index.php?page=fec">FEC (Forward Error-Correction) Protocol</a></h3>
<p>FEC specifically addresses the insertion and retrieval of Redundant Splitfiles.</p>

<p>
<h3><a href="/index.php?page=metadata">Freenet Metadata Spec</a></h3>
<p>This spec is for client metadata. It's intent is to provide
functionality for building web sites within Freenet, as well as
general description of the data inserted into Freenet.</p>
