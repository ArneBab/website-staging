<p><b>24th April, 2003 - Freenet in China</b><br>
Many, even among the Freenet development community, are unaware that for
over a year a group called <a
href="http://freenet-china.org/">Freenet-China</a> has been creating a
customized version of Freenet.  Freenet-China have taken the Freenet
software, given it a Chinese user interface and modified the
installation software.  This version of Freenet is used to distribute
daily news inside China that is free from government censorship.
<p>
It is certainly gratifying that there are people out there actually
using Freenet for exactly the purpose it was intended.  If you are
curious, you can download their version of Freenet from their <a
href="http://freenet-china.org/">website</a>.

<h3>What is Freenet?  An Executive Summary</h3>
Freenet is free software which lets you publish and obtain information
on the Internet without fear of censorship.  To achieve this freedom,
the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of
information are anonymous. Without anonymity there can never be true
freedom of speech, and without decentralization the network will be
vulnerable to attack.
<p>
Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are "routed-through"
other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is
requesting the information and what its content is.
<p>
Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of
their hard drive (called the "data store") for storing files. Unlike
other peer-to-peer file sharing networks, Freenet does not let the user
control what is stored in the data store. Instead, files are kept or
deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being
discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files in the
data store are encrypted to reduce the likelihood of prosecution by
persons wishing to censor Freenet content.
<p>
The network can be used in a number of different ways and isn't
restricted to just sharing files like other peer-to-peer networks. It
acts more like an Internet within an Internet. For example Freenet can
be used for:
<ul>
<li>Publishing websites or 'freesites'
<li>Communicating via message boards
<li>Playing simple turn-based games like Chess
<li>Content distribution
</ul>
<p>
Freenet is not just theoretical, it has been downloaded by over 1.2
million users since the project started, and it is used for the
distribution of censored information all over the world, including
countries such as China and the Middle East.  Ideas and concepts
pioneered in Freenet have <a
href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/1354204/420356">inspired</a>
hundreds of academic papers in the fields of computer communication,
security, and law.  Freenet has also received significant coverage in
the mainstream press.
