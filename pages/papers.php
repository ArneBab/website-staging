<a href="/22c3vid.html">Video of Small World talk, Berlin, December 2005</a><br>
This is a video of a talk given by Ian Clarke and Oskar Sandberg at the Chaos Computer Congress in Berlin, December 2005, describing the (then) new architecture for Freenet 0.7.  You can also download the <A

and the source for the Java <a

(requires Java 1.5).

<a href="http://www.math.chalmers.se/~ossa/lic.pdf">Searching in a Small World</a> (PDF)<br>
Oskar Sandberg's licentiate thesis describing a simple decentralized mechanism for constructing small world
networks that is inspired by Freenet's original design.  Part II of the thesis describes the basis for
the new Darknet architecture.

<a href="http://www.math.chalmers.se/~ossa/swroute.pdf">Distributed routing in Small World Networks</a> (PDF)<br>
A paper by Oskar Sandberg describing the theoretical basis for the new "Darknet" routing mechanism employed
by Freenet 0.7.

<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/492.en.html">Chaos Computer Congress Talk</a> 
(slideshow)<br>
This is a <a href="http://freenetproject.org/papers/ccc/ccc-slideshow.pdf.bz2">slideshow</a> for a talk given 
at the Chaos Computer Congress on 30th Dec 2005 in Berlin, Germany by Ian 
Clarke and Oskar Sandberg.  It described the new "darknet" approach to be employed in Freenet 0.7.  A Java 
demonstration to accompany the talk is <a 
href="http://freenetproject.org/papers/ccc/ccc-freenet-demo.tar.bz2">also</a> available.

<a href="index.php?page=ngrouting">Next Generation Routing Algorithm</a><br>
This article describes Freenet's "Next Generation" routing algorithm.  This was a novel
approach which had nodes making routing decisions based on sophisticated analysis of
the time required to route previous requests.  This algorithm was promising, but
was eventually dropped in favour of a much simpler approach in Freenet 0.7.

<a href="/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf">Protecting Freedom of Information 
Online with Freenet</a><br>
An IEEE Internet Computing article describing the Freenet architecture 
circa 2002 - probably the best introduction to the theory behind 
Freenet.

And an unofficial, more elaborate <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">Freenet Help Site</a> was created, to go deeper into the questions newbies may have about the usage and  inner-workings of Freenet.
