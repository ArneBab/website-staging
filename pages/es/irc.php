<h1>Chat with us on IRC</h1>

<p>Many of the developers and users of Freenet can often be found on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> channel,
#freenet on irc.freenode.org. Almost everyone on the channel is a volunteer, and 
may be busy with other things, so you may not get an instant answer: <b>Ask your 
question/say what the problem is, then wait for a few minutes, and somebody 
may help you</b>.</p>
