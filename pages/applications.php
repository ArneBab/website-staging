<h1>Applications

</h1>
<br/>A variety of people have written some excellent tools and clients for use with Freenet.
<br/>
<br/><h3>Freenet Publishing & Retrieval Tools
</h3>
<br/><a class='wiki'  href='http://localhost:8888/SSK@M7yZgrl8gwtAe1xEcR5Xyv4tFsoPAgM/fiw/6//'><b>Freesite Insertion Wizard</b></a> <b><span style='color:#FF0000;'>You must be running Freenet for this link to work.</span></b>
<br/>
<br/>FIW is a feature packed Java AWT application for inserting freesites.  It contains a lot of help at each stage of the process, and includes site verification to increase availability of the inserts.
<br/>
<br/><a class='wiki'  href='http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@kWu5Osv~VAI3-kH7z8QIVxklv-YPAgM/fishtools/34//'><b>FishTools</b></a> <b><span style='color:#FF0000;'>You must be running Freenet for this link to work.</span></b>

<br/>
<br/>Freesite insertion tools written in Python (standalone binaries are available for Windows). Includes FEC support for alternative handling of large files.
<br/>
<br/><a href='tiki-index.php?page=FCPTools' class='wiki'><b>FCPTools</b></a>
<br/>
<br/>FCPTools provide the same functionality as Freeweb, but without the GUI. Current working platforms include Win32, Linux, and FreeBSD. An ANSI-C based Client Lib (ezFCPlib) is also included to aid developers in writing Freenet clients.
<br/>
<br/><a class='wiki'  href='http://freeweb.sf.net/'><b>FreeWeb</b></a>
<br/>
<br/>FreeWeb allows websites to be inserted into Freenet. This tool does not appear to be currently maintained.
<br/>
<br/><b>KIO Freenet</b>
<br/>
<br/>KIO Freenet is a KDE IO-Slave, which provides KDE applications the ability to retrieve content from Freenet via FCP. <a class='wiki'  href='http://www.freenetproject.org/snapshots/kio_freenet.bz2'><b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Download</b> the source</a> and follow the instructions in INSTALL (<b>experimental</b>).

<br/>
<br/><h3>Message Board Tools and File Sharing tools
</h3>
<br/><a class='wiki'  href='http://jtcfrost.sf.net/'><b>Frost</b></a>
<br/>
<br/>Frost is a file-sharing tool for Freenet, it also has chat forums which allow people to chat anonymously over Freenet. It now supports FEC (which makes downloads more reliable).
<br/>
<br/><a class='wiki'  href='http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@h~ixmz11-tDOox9O1gQyjkzAUCcPAgM/fmb/5//'><b>Freenet Message Board</b></a> <b><span style='color:#FF0000;'>You must be running Freenet for this link to work.</span></b>
<br/>
<br/>FMB is an excellent Usenet-like tool which allows secure messages to be exchanged via Freenet, it is somewhat similar to Frost, but employs a more sophisticated "outbox" based approach. 
<br/>
<br/>It seems that the original author does not have the time to release new versions of it, some other Freenet users created modified versions.

<br/>
<br/>Liberator is a Unix command-line client designed to be easy to script (or cron). It's written in perl so it should be as portable as needed.

<br/>
<br/>Flinks is an application to help people gather, manage, and share links in freenet.  Currently, several indicies generate flinks data (<a class='wiki'  href='http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@-w495UL3mfSlWC2c~nRAuG2fAWwPAgM/TFEE//'><b>The Freedom Engine Engine</b></a>, <a class='wiki'  href='http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@Sc6qV~D6iFhaYord6HtbjJ8MaEYPAgM/YoYo//'><b>YoYo</b></a>, and the <a class='wiki'  href='http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@rjYFfgPHfolmcStiaoxESFfBXz8PAgM/FreenetHelp//'><b>Freenet Help Index</b></a>, among others (<b><span style='color:#FF0000;'>You must be running Freenet for those links to work.</span></b>)), so you can go to their page and <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">download</b> their links, allowing you to essentially build your own index with sites you like
