<body><h2>Download Freenet</h2>

<h3>Important note for first time users</h3>

When you first start Freenet your node will know very little about the
network, meaning that it could take <b>several minutes or longer</b> to 
retrieve a web page.  Please be patient since Freenet will learn how to 
find information more effectively over time and its speed will gradually 
improve with use.
<p>

<i>If you have a firewall or a NAT box click <a

for some info.</i>


<h3>Windows</h3>- Download and run <big><a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-java-webinstall.exe">freenet-java-webinstall.exe</a> </big>or<br>- If you already have Java 1.4.1 or later installed <big><a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-webinstall.exe">freenet-webinstall.exe</a></big><br><br>It will automatically install Freenet and other required components for you. When done, double-click on the small blue rabbit icon in your task-tray. <br>
(Freenet contains <u><b>NO spyware or adware</b></u> , it's Free Software! The source code is publicly available for review)	<p>Freenet works best with <b>Windows 2000, XP Professional or 
NT.</b>  Windows ME, 98 and 95 work less well.</p>
<!-- 2000 and Millenium Edition are different; all 2k's work good.  Millenium is also a bit borked.  The borked one is XP Home-->
<h3>Unix</h3>
You need to have a recent Java Runtime Environment.  We have experienced best results with Sun JRE 1.4.1 which can be obtained from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>.  Once Java is installed, download <a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-0.5.2.1.tar.gz">freenet-0.5.2.1.tar.gz</a>.  Get started by typing:
<pre>
$ tar xfz freenet-0.5.2.1.tar.gz
$ cd freenet
$ sh start-freenet.sh
</pre>
After you start Freenet wait a few seconds for it to start-up (on a slow computer, you may need to wait about 30 seconds), and visit http://127.0.0.1:8888/ in your web browser to access Freenet's user interface.

<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>
<b>Minimum:</b> 400MHz Pentium 2, with at least 192MB of RAM.<br>
<b>Recomended:</b> 1GHz or more processor with 256MB <!-- decreasing agaisnt my will :(-->RAM or 
more (especially if using Windows XP).

<h3>Upgrading</h3>

After installing Freenet, Windows users can upgrade to the latest daily Freenet "snapshot" release by clicking on "Update Snapshot" in the Freenet section of their Start menu.
<p>
Linux users may similarily upgrade by running the update.sh shell script in the freenet/ directory.
