<h2>Download Freenet</h2>

<h3>Important note for first time users</h3>

When you first start Freenet your node will know very little about the network 
- it could take up to <b>60 seconds</b> to open a website.  Keep trying,
because the more you use Freenet, the faster it will get.

<p>

<i>If you have a firewall or a NAT box click <a

for some info.</i>


<h3>Windows</h3>
Download and run  
<big><a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-webinstall.exe">freenet-webinstall.exe</a></big> if you have Java 1.4.1 or later installed, or <big><a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-java-webinstall.exe">freenet-java-webinstall.exe</a></big> if you don't (it will install Sun JRE 1.4.1_03).<br><br>
It will automatically install Freenet and other required components for you  (It contains 
<u><b>no</b> spyware or adware</u> , it's Free Software!). When done, double-click on the small blue 
rabbit icon in your task-tray.  Freenet works best with <b>Windows 2000, XP Professional or NT.</b> 
Windows ME, 98 and 95 work less well.
<!-- 2000 and Millenium Edition are different; all 2k's work good.  The borked one is XP Home-->
<h3>Unix</h3>
You need to have a recent Java Runtime Environment.  We have experienced best results with Sun JRE 1.4.1 which can be obtained from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>.  Once Java is installed, download <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freenet/freenet-0.5.2-rc4.tar.gz?download">freenet-0.5.2-rc4.tar.gz</a>.  Get started by typing:
<pre>
$ tar xfz freenet-0.5.2-rc4.tar.gz
$ cd freenet
$ sh start-freenet.sh
</pre>
After you start Freenet wait a few seconds for it to start-up (on a slow computer, you may need to wait about 30 seconds), and visit http://127.0.0.1:8888/ in your web browser to access Freenet's user interface.

<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>
<b>Minimum:</b> 400MHz Pentium 2, with at least 192MB of RAM.<br>
<b>Recomended:</b> 1GHz or more processor with 256MB <!-- decreasing agaisnt my will :(-->RAM or 
more (especially if using Windows XP).

<h3>Upgrading</h3>

After installing Freenet, Windows users can upgrade to the latest daily Freenet "snapshot" release by clicking on "Update Snapshot" in the Freenet section of their Start menu.
<p>
Linux users may similarily upgrade by running the update.sh shell script in the freenet/ directory.
