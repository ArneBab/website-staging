<b>19th May, 2004 : Paypal appears to have reinstated Freenet 
account</b><br>
We received a seemingly automatic message from Paypal indicating that 
our account has been restored:
<blockquote>
Thank you for taking the steps to restore your account access. Your
patience and efforts increase security for our entire community of
users.
</blockquote>
Unfortunately, it seems that the steps they refer to involve being a 
sufficiently high-profile project that it generates potentially damaging 
publicity.
<p>
Our feeling is that in the absence of an explanation or apology from 
Paypal, we will not continue usage of their service.  Paypal may have a 
legal right to discontinue service to its customers, but it has a moral 
obligation to offer a reasonable explanation for its actions, 
particularly where a faithful and profitable customer such as the 
Freenet Project Inc is concerned.

<b>18th May, 2004 : Freenet now accepts donations through Amazon Honor System</b><br>
After Freenet's account was shut down by Paypal, we have now migrated over to using 
Amazon's Honor System, which appears at least as easy to use as Paypal.  If you would like 
to make a contribution to the project please visit our <a 
href="/index.php?page=donate">donations</a> page.  Unfortunately we still haven't found a 
suitable replacement for the Paypal subscription mechanism, but we continue to work on it.

<b>17th May, 2004 : Paypal suspends Freenet donations account</b><br>
Paypal has frozen the account we use to accept donations over the web, they refuse to give 
any reason other than "use
of an anonymous proxy", which suggests that someone at Paypal took a dislike to the goals
of our project, since I have never used an anonymous proxy to access Paypal (this being
the activity I assume they sought to prevent).  It is fortunate that 
Johann Gutenberg did not rely on Paypal to 
fund his work on the printing press, which also allowed anonymous publication of 
information, since his account would probably have been frozen too.

If you are concerned 
about whether your account might be at risk due to your political opinions you may wish to 
speak to their PR 
contact Hani Durzy at (408) 376 7458.  If you are an investor and you would like to see 
what other political opinions Paypal doesn't like, you may want to speak to their 
Investor contact Tracey Ford at 
(408) 376 7205.
<p>
They have said that they will refund our outstanding balance ($550) by check, but all of 
the projects subscriptions have been canceled which is a significant setback.
Other means of accepting donations, including E-Gold, are still active. Anyone wishing to 
make a donation by check should email <a href="mailto:ian@locut.us">me</a> directly.  
Unfortunately neither of these methods are as convenient as Paypal, but we will do our best to find an 
alternative ASAP.
