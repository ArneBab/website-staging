<p><b>25th April, 2004 - Stable build 5077, and immediate future</b></p>
Please upgrade to stable build 5077. You can do this by using the update.sh
utility on *nix, or freenet-webinstall.exe on Windows, or by downloading the
jar from <a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-latest.jar">here</a>.
This build merges an enormous quantity of work from the unstable branch, including
a fix for a very serious bug affecting inserts, some optimizations, refactoring, many
more bug fixes, a substantial reduction in memory usage with the fixing of many memory
leaks, and a major change to how freenet nodes work together ("bidirectional routing").
Like previous builds, there will probably be bugs in it, and we would as always 
welcome bug reports at <a href="mailto:support@freenetproject.org">support@freenetproject.org</a>.
We will not see the full effects of the changes until most of the stable branch 
network have upgraded, so please upgrade ASAP. If you don't have a Freenet node
installed, now is a great time to <a href="/index.php?page=download">download</a> one.
We are trying to work towards getting a 0.6 prerelease out, but recent network tests
suggest we may need to deal with one more major network level issue first (but 5077 
should nonetheless be a significant improvement). We will need to do more debugging,
 of course, and we may or may not implement automatic IP address detection for 
firewalled nodes before 0.6.
<p><b>10th April, 2004 - Demonstrate against Software Patents in Europe</b></p>
A <a href="http://demo.ffii.org/online.php">demonstration</a> is taking place
on 14th April in Brussels against the introduction of software patents in
the European Union.  Put simply, software patents are one of the greatest threats
to innovation in the world today, they increase the cost and risk of innovation, 
and allow unscrupulous individuals and companies to extort money from 
innovators.
<p>
If software patents were in wide usage 15 years ago, revolutionary 
innovations such as the Internet would have been delayed by years, perhaps even 
indefinitely.  The EU has been heavily lobbied by those that stand to gain from
the introduction of software patents (including the Patent departments of companies
like Nokia) so it is essential that innovators, and those that care about innovation, 
make their feelings heard.

<p><b>8th March, 2004 - DEF CON donates $1,500 to the Freenet Project</b></p>
<a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a> Communications, Inc has generously 
donated $1,500 to the Freenet Project.  
DEF CON is the world's largest annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker</a> 
convention, held every year in Las Vegas, Nevada.  
In the words of DEF CON's Jeff Moss: "Freenet is doing interesting 
work, and DEF CON likes to support privacy projects. DEF CON is not rich, 
but Freenet is small enough that our donations hopefully make a difference".
<p>
These funds will be used to support the continued employment of Freenet's
grossly underpaid full-time developer, Matthew Toseland.  The Freenet
Project also gratefully acknowledges the contributions of other
supporters of the project which have allowed us to raise over $5,000
in the past few weeks thus providing for Matthew's continued employment
for the next few months.
<p>
Freenet's project coordinator, Ian Clarke, will be speaking at the next
DEF CON and will provide an update on the project's progress along
with providing an opportunity for people to ask questions about the
project.
