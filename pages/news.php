<p><b>23rd June, 2003 - Ian responds to Peacefire paper</b><br>
Ian just posted a <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/~Sanity/journal/37275">response</a> 
to Bennett Haselton's paper <i>Why a 
"distributed cloud" of peer-to-peer systems will not be able to 
circumvent Internet blocking in the long run</i> on his <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/~sanity/journal">weblog</a> today.  In it 
he argues that the attack Bennett describes, while being a 
theoretical possibility, would be practically impossible even for the 
best-funded of government Internet censors.

<p><b>14th June, 2003 - Your support needed</b><br>
Things have been progressing well, we have almost finished a major 
architectural improvement (migrating to java.nio) which should lead to 
a significant reduction in Freenet's cpu usage, and we are working on 
the most fundamental improvement to Freenet's core algorithm since its 
original design - NGRouting.
<br>
Matthew Toseland, our full time developer, has been a major catalyst to 
Freenet development, however his contract is coming to an end and the 
project's funds are presently very low.  As a result I am making this 
appeal for your financial support.  If you can afford to - please visit 
our <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donations</a> page, you can 
contribute with a credit card through Paypal, or via E-Gold if you 
prefer.
