<p><b>24th April, 2003 - Freenet in China</b><br>
Many, even among the Freenet development community, are unaware that for
over a year a group called <a
href="http://freenet-china.org/">Freenet-China</a> has been creating a
customized version of Freenet.  Freenet-China have taken the Freenet
software, given it a Chinese user interface and modified the
installation software.  This version of Freenet is used to distribute
daily news inside China that is free from government censorship.
<p>
It is certainly gratifying that there are people out there actually
using Freenet for exactly the purpose it was intended.  If you are
curious, you can download their version of Freenet from their <a
href="http://freenet-china.org/">website</a>.
