<b>12th July, 2004 : Status Update</b><br>
Things have been progressing rapidly in the unstable branch over the
past few weeks.  Along with the usual flow of bug fixes, Matthew
has made some interesting discoveries by setting up a local "testnet",
and is in the process of integrating these lessons into the 
<a href="/index.php?page=ngrouting">next-gen routing</a> algorithm.
We have continued to experience problems with excessive "route not
found" errors, particularly when a node has just started up, and
are working on a variety of solutions to this problem.
