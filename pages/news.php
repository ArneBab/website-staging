<p><b>22nd November, 2003 - Your support needed</b></p>
We are making rapid progress towards our <b>0.6</b> release, which will
contain a variety of fundamental improvements to Freenet.  As most
are aware, our development effort has received a significant boost by
being able to employ Matthew Toseland full-time to work on the project,
paid for by your generous donations.
<p>
Unfortunately the fundamental nature of the changes we are working on 
make it impossible for us to do formal "point" releases of the software, 
and these have traditionally been when we receive most of our donations.  
As a result, the project's current funding levels are so low that we can 
only afford to continue employing Matthew for another couple of days as 
things stand right now.
<p>
Because of this, we are making an appeal for donations so that we can 
keep Matthew working on the project, as many will know, his involvement 
as provided valuable momentum to the development effort.  Matthew is 
paid just a fraction of what he could earn working commercially, so you 
can be sure that your contribution will be well spent.
<p>
If you can spare any money, please visit our <a 
href="/index.php?page=donate">donations page</a> and make a 
contribution.  You can donate via Paypal using a credit card, or via 
E-Gold.  Your support is much appreciated.
