<p><b>31st August, 2003 - Next Gen Routing now in Unstable Branch</b></p>
For the past few months we have been designing and implementing a radical
new mechanism for finding information in Freenet called "Next Generation
Routing".  This was described in a recent <a href="/index.php?page=ngrouting">
article</a> by Ian Clarke.  We have been testing and refining this new code
in our "experimental" development branch, and now we deem it stable enough
to be moved into our "unstable" branch where we will test it further before
moving it to "stable", eventually releasing it as Freenet 0.6.  We have
put together some simple instructions for Freenet users who would like
to try it out <a href="index.php?page=tryng">here</a>.
