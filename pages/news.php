<p><b>28th October, 2003 - Next Generation Routing now in 
"stable" build</b></p>
After months of work we have finally decided that the "Next Generation 
Routing" code is ready for wider testing and have thus merged it into 
the "stable" build of Freenet.
<p>
Next Generation Routing or NGR represents a <b>major</b> change to the 
way freenet searches for data, while still preserving the underlying 
principles of its operation.  For example, Freenet now considers actual 
network latency and bandwidth while making its routing decisions, while 
also considering many other factors including reliability and the load 
imposed on other nodes in the Freenet network.  We believe these 
advances help to keep Freenet on the cutting-edge of P2P research while 
also providing our users with a useful if far-from complete piece of 
software.  To learn more about NGR see 
<a href="http://freenetproject.org/index.php?page=ngrouting">here</a>.
<p>
NGR is far from being the only improvement.  We have continued to 
migrate Freenet over to Java's new non-blocking IO API.  We have made 
major changes to Freenet's handling of connections to other nodes, added 
many new diagnostics and configuration options, and fixed many bugs.
<p>
We believe that this new build will be a great improvement on build 5028 
and we urge all users to upgrade, while cautioning that it is unlikely 
to be without bugs.
<p>
As always, while many have generously donated their time and 
considerable expertise to these advances, they would not have been 
possible without the dedication and hard work of Freenet's grossly 
underpaid full-time developer, Matthew Toseland.  Please help us 
continue to grossly underpay him by making a donation to the project 
on our <a

page.
