<p><b>8th March, 2004 - DEF CON donates $1,500 to the Freenet Project</b></p>
<a href=http://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a> Communications, Inc has generously 
donated $1,500 to the Freenet Project.  
DEF CON is the world's largest annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker</a> 
convention, held every year in Las Vegas, Nevada.  
In the words of DEF CON's Jeff Moss: "Freenet is doing interesting 
work, and DEF CON likes to support privacy projects. DEF CON is not rich, 
but Freenet is small enough that our donations hopefully make a difference".
<p>
These funds will be used to support the continued employment of Freenet's
grossly underpaid full-time developer, Matthew Toseland.  The Freenet
Project also gratefully acknowledges the contributions of other
supporters of the project which have allowed us to raise over $5,000
in the past few weeks thus providing for Matthew's continued employment
for the next few months.
<p>
Freenet's project coordinator, Ian Clarke, will be speaking at the next
DEF CON and will provide an update on the project's progress along
with providing an opportunity for people to ask questions about the
project.

<b>3rd March, 2004 - Freenet Help Site available</b></p>
An unofficial, more elaborate <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">Freenet Help Site</a> was created, to go deeper into the questions newbies may have about the usuage and  inner-workings of Freenet.
