<p><b>29th August, 2003 - Fight Software Patents in EU</b></p>
The European Commission has proposed to introduce US-style software patents
in Europe.  This would be a disaster for innovation and competition in the
European software industry as it would allow large companies to hoard
software patents and use them to shut down smaller competitors.  Free software
projects such as Freenet would be particularly vulnerable.  Visitors to this
site that live within the EU are encouraged to write to their MEPs to register
their concerns about this proposal.  Please visit <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">

<p><b>23rd August, 2003 - Next Gen routing now in experimental branch</b></p>
The most fundamental improvement to Freenet's core algorithm, "Next Generation
Routing", is now in the experimental branch of CVS.  NGrouting holds the
promise of making Freenet much faster than it is today, while improving
virtually all aspects of Freenet's performance.  To learn more about
NGrouting see <a href="/index.php?page=ngrouting">here</a>, if you would
like to try it out see <a href="/index.php?page=tryng">here</a>.
