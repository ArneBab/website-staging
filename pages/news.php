<p><b>31st August, 2003 - Next Gen Routing now in Unstable Branch</b></p>
For the past few months we have been designing and implementing a radical
new mechanism for finding information in Freenet called "Next Generation
Routing".  This was described in a recent <a href="/index.php?page=ngrouting">
article</a> by Ian Clarke.  We have been testing and refining this new code
in our "experimental" development branch, and now we deem it stable enough
to be moved into our "unstable" branch where we will test it further before
moving it to "stable", eventually releasing it as Freenet 0.6.  We have
put together some simple instructions for Freenet users who would like
to try it out <a href="index.php?page=tryng">here</a>.

<p><b>29th August, 2003 - Fight Software Patents in EU</b></p>
The European Commission has proposed to introduce US-style software patents
in Europe.  This would be a disaster for innovation and competition in the
European software industry as it would allow large companies to hoard
software patents and use them to shut down smaller competitors.  Free software
projects such as Freenet would be particularly vulnerable.  Visitors to this
site that live within the EU are encouraged to write to their MEPs to register
their concerns about this proposal.  Please visit <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">
