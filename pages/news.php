<b>03/03/04 - Freenet Help Site available</b></p>
An unofficial, more elaborate <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">Freenet Help Site</a> was created, to go deeper into the questions newbies may have about the usuage and  inner-workings of Freenet.

<b>26th February, 2004 - Freenet Stable build 5072 released</b></p>
This new build incorporates the new "rate limiting" load balancing 
mechanism discussed <a href="/index.php?page=stateof180204">here</a>.
Rate limiting has proven
surprisingly effective in the unstable branch, typically keeping
a node's load within a few percentage points of where it is supposed
to be.  This is in stark contrast to previous load balancing attempts
where load was continuously so high as to render Freenet nodes almost
completely useless.  
<p>
This build also fixes a number of bugs that were causing
excessive memory usage.  We anticipate more such fixes in the future,
but users should notice significant improvement already.
<p>
Existing users can upgrade to this snapshot.  Linux users should run
the "update.sh" script in their freenet directory, Windows users
should use the upgrade option in the Freenet section of their Start
Menu.

<p><b>18th February, 2004 - State of the Freenet</b></p>
