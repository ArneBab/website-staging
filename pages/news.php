<b>17th May, 2004 : Paypal suspends Freenet donations account</b><br>
Paypal has frozen the account we use to accept donations over the web, they refuse to give 
any reason other than "use
of an anonymous proxy", which suggests that someone at Paypal took a dislike to the goals
of our project, since I have never used an anonymous proxy to access Paypal (this being
the activity I assume they sought to prevent).  It is fortunate that 
Johann Gutenberg did not rely on Paypal to 
fund his work on the printing press, which also allowed anonymous publication of 
information, since his account would probably have been frozen too.
<p>
They have said that they will refund our outstanding balance ($550) by check, but all of 
the projects subscriptions have been canceled which is a significant setback.
Other means of accepting donations, including E-Gold, are still active. Anyone wishing to 
make a donation by check should email <a href="mailto:ian@locut.us">me</a> directly.  
Unfortunately neither of these methods are as convenient as Paypal, but we will do our best to find an 
alternative ASAP.
