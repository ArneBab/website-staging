<p><b>18th July, 2003 - Subscribe to a Freenet Project Membership</b></p>
While we are most grateful for the generous donations of our users,
one of the biggest problems for the Freenet project is that the amount of donations we receive
in a given month can fluctuate quite a bit, making it impossible to know for sure from month
to month whether we will be able to continue paying our full-time developer, Matthew Toseland.
<p>
To address this issue we have decided to allow people to subscribe to a Freenet Project "Membership",
which will can be $5, $10, or $20 per month, and which will provide a more robust and reliable 
source of income for the project.  While at the moment the only benefit to being a member will 
be that warm fuzzy feeling you get inside knowing that you are contributing towards an important 
project - we will
think of other ways to reward our members more directly in the future.  If you are 
interested in supporting the Freenet Project by subscribing to a membership, and if you have a 
PayPal account - please click on this button:

appreciated.
<p><b>16th July, 2003 - Freenet 0.5.2 Released!</b><br>
<p>After four months work, Freenet 0.5.2 is now <a href="/index.php?page=download"><b>available
for download</b></a>.
<p>It features a new NIO technology that brings improved performance 
using less CPU and system resources. Individual
nodes are now more efficient and the speed and routing of the entire network have significantly 
improved.
<p> We also implemented
probabilistic caching, which further improves routing and lets Freenet
store and find more data. There are some user interface
improvements, more improvements to downloads of large files,
a fix for the Heisenbug and tons of others.
<p>Progress has only been 
possible at this rate because, thanks to your donations, the project has been able to pay a
full time developer for the bargain rate of $1500/month.  We have some very exciting things 
planned for the next release such as a revolutionary new routing mechanism called NGRouting, so if you haven't already done so, please 
consider <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donating</a>.</p>
