<p><b>25th April, 2004 - Stable build 5077, and immediate future</b></p>
Please upgrade to stable build 5077. You can do this by using the update.sh
utility on *nix, or freenet-webinstall.exe on Windows, or by downloading the
jar from <a href="http://freenetproject.org/snapshots/freenet-latest.jar">here</a>.
This build merges an enormous quantity of work from the unstable branch, including
a fix for a very serious bug affecting inserts, some optimizations, refactoring, many
more bug fixes, a substantial reduction in memory usage with the fixing of many memory
leaks, and a major change to how freenet nodes work together ("bidirectional routing").
Like previous builds, there will probably be bugs in it, and we would as always 
welcome bug reports at <a href="mailto:support@freenetproject.org">support@freenetproject.org</a>.
We will not see the full effects of the changes until most of the stable branch 
network have upgraded, so please upgrade ASAP. If you don't have a Freenet node
installed, now is a great time to <a href="/index.php?page=download">download</a> one.
We are trying to work towards getting a 0.6 prerelease out, but recent network tests
suggest we may need to deal with one more major network level issue first (but 5077 
should nonetheless be a significant improvement). We will need to do more debugging,
 of course, and we may or may not implement automatic IP address detection for 
firewalled nodes before 0.6.
