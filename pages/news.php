<p><b>4th July, 2003 - Freenet 0.5.2-rc3 Released!</b><br>
Freenet 0.5.2 release candidate 3 has been released. You can get 
it from <a href="/index.php?page=download">the download page</a>.
The main change in this prerelease is the implementation of java.nio,
which should significantly improve performance. It also has a 
simple/expert mode switch for the user interface. All the bugfixes 
(such as the heisenbug fix), and new features (background splitfile
downloads, probabilistic caching) from the previous release candidates
are also incorporated in this snapshot. We would have released 0.5.2
earlier but the network performance was unacceptable for a release.
As always, we need more <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donations</a>
to continue the work.

<p><b>23rd June, 2003 - Ian responds to Peacefire paper</b><br>
Ian just posted a <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/~Sanity/journal/37275">response</a> 
to Bennett Haselton's paper <i>"Why a 
'distributed cloud' of peer-to-peer systems will not be able to 
circumvent Internet blocking in the long run"</i> on his <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/~sanity/journal">weblog</a> today.  In it 
he argues that the attack Bennett describes, while being a 
theoretical possibility, would be practically impossible even for the 
best-funded of government Internet censors.

<p><b>14th June, 2003 - Your support needed</b><br>
Things have been progressing well, we have almost finished a major 
architectural improvement (migrating to java.nio) which should lead to 
a significant reduction in Freenet's cpu usage, and we are working on 
the most fundamental improvement to Freenet's core algorithm since its 
original design - NGRouting.
<br>
Matthew Toseland, our full time developer, has been a major catalyst to 
Freenet development, however his contract is coming to an end and the 
project's funds are presently very low.  As a result I am making this 
appeal for your financial support.  If you can afford to - please visit 
our <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donations</a> page, you can 
contribute with a credit card through Paypal, or via E-Gold if you 
prefer.
