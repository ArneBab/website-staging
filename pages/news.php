<p>We have selected 6 students to work for us over the summer, paid for by 
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/freenet/about.html">Google Summer of Code</a>.<p>
<p>These are:
<ul>
<li><b>Swati Goyal</b> will be working on improving searching in Freenet.</li>
<li><b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Rechtenstein</b> will be building us a blogging plugin.</li>
<li><b>Alberto Bacchelli</b> will be building a test framework and many unit tests.</li>
<li><b>Vilhelm Verendel</b> will be working on simulating the growth of the network.</li>
<li><b>Srivatsan</b> will be working on improving Freenet's connection encryption and possibly on darknet introductions.</li>
<li><b>Mladen Kolar</b> will be building a definitive C/C++ library for the <a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/FreenetFCPSpec2Point0">Freenet Client Protocol</a>.</li></p>
</ul><p>Congratulations to all of these students. Last year's Summer of Code yielded results including
<a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/Thaw">Thaw</a>, <a href="http://wiki.freenetproject.org/Freemail">Freemail</a>,
new low-level simulations and a great deal of work on the installer, packaging and general bugfixing. Even better,
two of last year's students are now core developers themselves mentoring Summer of Code students this year !
