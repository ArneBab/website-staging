<b>27th October, 2004 : Stable build 5099, Stable network reset</b>
<p>Stable build 5099 has been released, all users running the stable
branch should upgrade as this build contains numerous important bugfixes,
mostly related to inserts. The network has been reset because of this.
There are also many changes since 5090, such as the introduction of 
request queueing, a technique to reduce RNFs and improve routing 
accuracy. The network seems a bit overloaded at present and not all content
authors have updated, but it should improve significantly as testing went
well. Instructions for upgrading or installing are <a href="/index.php?page=download">here</a>.</p>
