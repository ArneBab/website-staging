<b>6th August, 2004 : Stable build 5090, Stable network reset</b>
<p>Stable build 5090 has now been released, all users running the stable
branch should upgrade as this build contains numerous important bugfixes,
including a fix for a 4-month-old bug that was causing lots more Route
Not Found errors than there should be. Also, the stable network has been
reset as of 5090, so you will need to reseed. This is partly because of
the big changes in 5085, and partly because of bugs in 5085 up to 5088.
Instructions for installing or upgrading are <a href="/index.php?page=download">
