<p><b>6th October, 2003 - Misleading Rumors</b></p>
There have been some misleading 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/06/1058250&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=158&tid=95&tid=99">
rumors</a> circulating over the past
day or two that there is an effort to create a "fork" of Freenet.
This is not true.  There have also been some rather peculiar
<a href="http://p2pnet.net/article/8315">reports</a> that the
Freenet 0.6 release was premature.  This is news to the entire
Freenet development team as there are no immediate plans to
release Freenet 0.6.  Visitors to <b>p2pnet.net</b> should take
note of that news source's apparent disregard for accuracy.
<p>
There was some discussion among the Freenet developers about how
we can improve the stability of Freenet's stable branch, without
hampering experimentation with Freenet's development branch.  We
have now arrived at a consensus as to how this can be achieved.
<p>
In short, despite some recent issues caused by a significant overhaul
of some core code, Freenet development is healthier than ever and
progressing well.
<p><b>15th September, 2003 - Ian Clarke selected as top
Innovator of 2003</b></p>
