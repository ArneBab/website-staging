<b>20th November, 2004 : Software patents protest</b>
<p>The EU Council of Ministers is trying to push through a Directive which would allow software patents in the EU.  
Software patents are one of the greatest threats to innovation in the world today, and will have a particularly negative 
effect on Open Source software such as Freenet.  The Council is trying to push through this Directive without discussion at 
a fisheries meeting (!) despite the opposition of national parliaments. Click <a

<b>8th November, 2004 : Unofficial Freenet RPMs now available</b>

upgrade conveniently using Yum or Apt-rpm.  You can find further 
information <a

<b>27th October, 2004 : Stable build 5099, Stable network reset</b>
<p>Stable build 5099 has been released, all users running the stable
branch should upgrade as this build contains numerous important bugfixes,
mostly related to inserts. The network has been reset because of this.
There are also many changes since 5090, such as the introduction of 
request queueing, a technique to reduce RNFs and improve routing 
accuracy. The network seems a bit overloaded at present and not all content
authors have updated, but it should improve significantly as testing went
well. Instructions for upgrading or installing are <a href="/index.php?page=download">here</a>.</p>
