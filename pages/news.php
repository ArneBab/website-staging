<h3>News</h3>
<b>3rd July, 2006 - Freenet Status report</b><br>
The pace of coding on Freenet has increased dramatically since the
release of the 0.7 alpha. We now have an active group of core developers
working with Matthew Toseland (our full-time dev), and a growing
community of developers working on third-party applications through the
Freenet Client Protocol. After the rather stagnant period before the
decision to switch to a darknet model, Freenet is now more active and
vibrant than it has ever been.
<p>
Current estimates put the size of the darknet between 300-400 nodes, not
bad for a hard-to-use alpha release, and we are seeing an average of
about 50 commits per week from developers. We have 4 Google Summer of
Code projects working on everything from a new load-balancing mechanism,
to a cross-platform file upload and download utility (called "Thaw"),
and a flexible user-friendly installer.
<p>
We have also been thinking hard about how to minimize the inherent
usability challenges posed by a darknet approach, and with this in mind,
have implemented support for third party applications to add and remove
darknet connections via FCP. This means we can do things like write IM
plugins to make it very easy to establish connections to friends.
<p>
We will also be deploying "opennet" functionality, so that users who
don't need the security offered by the darknet, can just start up a node
and get going immediately, as with previous versions of Freenet, but
this time with the benefits of NAT circumvention and a UDP-based
transport.
<p>
On the more administrative side, Florent Daigniere has been a big help,
setting up a bug tracker, and a
variety of other tools to help streamline Freenet's development process.
<p>
Its not all good news though, despite the generosity of many of our
users, donations to the project have been unable to keep-up with the
$2300 per month (a meager salary for a software developer in the UK)
needed by Matthew Toseland, and right now we are on the verge of not
being able to continue to pay him - which would obviously be terrible
for the project. In the past, users and supporters of the project have
been extremely generous when we have asked them to help us out of a
financial hole, and I am hoping that you can be similarly generous on
this occasion.
<p>
With this in mind, I would ask that you visit our donations page on the
website, it can be found <a href="http://freenetproject.org/donate.html">here</a>.
<p>
And please donate anything you can spare.
