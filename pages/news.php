<p><b>12th July, 2003 - Freenet 0.5.2-rc4 Released!</b><br></p>
<p>Freenet 0.5.2 release candidate 4 has been released. You can get 
it from <a href="/index.php?page=download">the download page</a>.</p>
<p>After the implementation of NIO in release candidate 3, this release
concentrates on bugfixing and tuning. NIO should improve performance
significantly over RC2 or earlier; it should now work on Win9X/WinME,
and use less CPU and significantly memory than RC3. It also has
improvements to the splitfile code amongst other areas. The final 
0.5.2 should be released in the coming days, <i>so please test this one and
help us find any remaining bugs!</i> </p>
<p>Freenet development is considerably accelerated by our ability 
to pay a full time developer out of donations, so please if you 
like Freenet consider <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donating</a>.</p>

<p><b>23rd June, 2003 - Ian responds to Peacefire paper</b><br>
Ian just posted a <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/~Sanity/journal/37275">response</a> 
to Bennett Haselton's paper <i>"Why a 
'distributed cloud' of peer-to-peer systems will not be able to 
circumvent Internet blocking in the long run"</i> on his <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/~sanity/journal">weblog</a> today.  In it 
he argues that the attack Bennett describes, while being a 
theoretical possibility, would be practically impossible even for the 
best-funded of government Internet censors.

<p><b>14th June, 2003 - Your support needed</b><br>
Things have been progressing well, we have almost finished a major 
architectural improvement (migrating to java.nio) which should lead to 
a significant reduction in Freenet's cpu usage, and we are working on 
the most fundamental improvement to Freenet's core algorithm since its 
original design - NGRouting.
<br>
Matthew Toseland, our full time developer, has been a major catalyst to 
Freenet development, however his contract is coming to an end and the 
project's funds are presently very low.  As a result I am making this 
appeal for your financial support.  If you can afford to - please visit 
our <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donations</a> page, you can 
contribute with a credit card through Paypal, or via E-Gold if you 
prefer.
