<b>9th September, 2005: Major new version of Freenet expected by Christmas</b><br>
Freenet is currently undergoing a major re-write incorporating a number of fundamental changes. Version 0.7 of Freenet aims to create a scalable darknet, where users only connect directly to other users they know and trust. The purpose of this change is to protect users who may be placed at risk simply by using the software, irrespective of what they are using it for. In the new model, only people you choose to connect to will know that you are running the software. Previous darknets, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASTE">WASTE</a>, have been limited to relatively small disconnected networks. The core innovation in Freenet 0.7 will be to allow a globally scalable darknet, capable of supporting millions of users. This is made possible by the fact that human relationships tend to form small-world networks, a property that can be exploited to find short paths between any two people. The work is based on based a talk given at <a href="http://defcon.org/">DEFCON 13</a> by Ian Clarke and Oskar Sandberg (<a href="http://freenetproject.org/papers/vegas1_dc.pdf">slides available here</a>).
<p>
Other modifications include switching from TCP to UDP, which allows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching">UDP hole punching</a> along with faster transmission of messages between peers in the network. While previously Freenet only supported the insertion and retrieval of information, Freenet 0.7 will support new modes of usage including the real-time broadcast of messages. Applications of this range from real-time anonymous chat (perhaps through the IRC protocol) to RSS-feeds.
<p>
While many contributors to the project do so voluntarily, using donations through this website, the project has been able to employ one developer full-time, Matthew Toseland.  Matthew has since become the backbone of the Freenet development effort.  The project is always in need of additional funds to assure Matthew's continued employment, so if you can contribute to our efforts, please visit our <a href="/index.php?page=donate">donations</a> page.
