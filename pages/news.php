<b>27th October, 2004 : Stable build 5099, Stable network reset</b>
<p>Stable build 5099 has been released, all users running the stable
branch should upgrade as this build contains numerous important bugfixes,
mostly related to inserts. The network has been reset because of this.
There are also many changes since 5090, such as the introduction of 
request queueing, a technique to reduce RNFs and improve routing 
accuracy. The network seems a bit overloaded at present and not all content
authors have updated, but it should improve significantly as testing went
well. Instructions for upgrading or installing are <a href="/index.php?page=download">here</a>.</p>
<b>6th August, 2004 : Stable build 5090, Stable network reset</b>
<p>Stable build 5090 has now been released, all users running the stable
branch should upgrade as this build contains numerous important bugfixes,
including a fix for a 4-month-old bug that was causing lots more Route
Not Found errors than there should be. Also, the stable network has been
reset as of 5090, so you will need to reseed. This is partly because of
the big changes in 5085, and partly because of bugs in 5085 up to 5088.
