<b>18th February, 2006: Searching in a Small World</b><br>
Oskar Sandberg has made available his thesis <a href="http://www.math.chalmers.se/~ossa/lic.pdf">Searching in a Small World</a>.
This describes a simple decentralized algorithm for creating small world networks that is inspired by Freenet's original

small world networks might form naturally among human relationships.

<b>3rd January, 2006: Slides and Demo from Chaos Congress talk now online</b><br>
On Friday 30th Oskar Sandberg and I <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/492.en.html">spoke</a>
at the 22nd Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin, Germany.  We were speaking about
the upcoming 0.7 redesign of Freenet.  Now that I have thawed out 
(it was -6&deg;C!), I have had a chance to upload our <a href="http://freenetproject.org/papers/ccc/ccc-slideshow.pdf.bz2">slideshow</a> (pdf.bz2 format), and a Java <a href="http://freenetproject.org/papers/ccc/ccc-freenet-demo.tar.bz2">demo</a> 
(requires Java 1.5).
