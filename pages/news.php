<b>24th May, 2004 : Paypal apologises</b><br>
Today we received an email from Amy Stohlman, an AUP Supervisor at Paypal.
She said:
<blockquote>
I sincerely apologize for the difficulties you have encountered with 
your PayPal account.  The company values your business, and I would 
like to offer my apologies for the inconvenience you may have 
experienced as a result of the limitation placed on your PayPal 
account, as well as an explanation for the reason the limited access 
occurred.
<p>
Your PayPal account [...] was placed under 
limited access on May 17, 2004, when a review of the website from which 
you were accepting donations indicated the use of an anonymizing proxy, 
which is a violation of our user agreement.  Often, when there are 
issues with a PayPal account, the account is limited in order to 
protect both buyers and sellers.   
<p>
Further review of your PayPal account in conjunction with your website 
indicated that while you were accepting donations for this service, you 
were not using an anonymizing proxy to access your PayPal account.  
Accordingly, full access was restored to your account on May 18, 
2004.  [...]
</blockquote>
We feel that this is a fair response to our concerns and have <a href="/index.php?page=donate">restored</a>
Paypal donations.  Our only regrets
are that it took so long to get to this point, and that Paypal's initial
reaction was that there could be no appeal against this decision.  
We would like to extend
our thanks to everyone that helped to persuade Paypal to take a closer
look at our case.  I responded to Ms Stohlman with
some suggestions for how this situation can be avoided with other
customers in the future - Ian
