<b>17th May, 2004 : Paypal suspends Freenet donations account</b><br>
Paypal has frozen the account we use to accept donations over the web, they refuse to give 
any reason other than "use
of an anonymous proxy", which suggests that someone at Paypal took a dislike to the goals
of our project, since I have never used an anonymous proxy to access Paypal (this being
the activity I assume they sought to prevent).  It is fortunate that the anonymous authors
of The Federalist Papers, the precursor to the US Constitution, did not rely on Paypal to 
fund their activities or, one assumes, their account would have been frozen too.
<p>
They have said that they will refund our outstanding balance ($550) by check, but all of 
the projects subscriptions have been cancelled which is a significant setback.
Other means of accepting donations, including E-Gold, are still active. Anyone wishing to 
make a donation by check should email <a href="mailto:ian@locut.us">me</a> directly.  
Unfortunately neither of these methods are as convenient as Paypal, but we will do our best to find an 
alternative ASAP.
