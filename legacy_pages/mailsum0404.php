<span style='color:blue'><b>RNFs still a problem?
</b></span><P>

<p>
I am still seeing plenty of RNFs in 60067 (node has been up for a few hours and has been trying to do a splitfile download). Generally are other people still experiencing excessive RNFs? Under what circumstances? I would really like to get a better understanding of why they are happening.

Malcolm handley responded by stating that he was seeing a lot of RNFs when inserting data. In a recent test that he did he got 48 RNFs in the course of inserting 30 4kb blocks. (He repeatedly tried to insert blocks until he had inserted the number that he wanted and recorded the number of errors that he got on the way.) He was not sure how many he was getting when requesting data at that moment, but it was also quite a few. Someone with the nick 'Someone' said he was not getting much RNFs. But when he got them it was almost always caused by nodes restarting (according to the RNF output).
